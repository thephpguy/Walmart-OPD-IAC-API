Overview
The Channel Performance Inventory Action Capture (IAC) API provides the capability for Pay-For-Scan (PFS) Suppliers to send their Walmart store inventory actions back to the Walmart Enterprise Inventory. This provides both Walmart and the Supplier with insights into the actual availability of items. This insight can help Suppliers track item availability and take actions to help reduce out-of-stock at Walmart stores.
